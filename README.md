## Core Text Label 
- An iOS class that lets you get started rendering basic Core Text in your apps. It's essentially a subclass of UILabel that allows you to set kerning, line height, & multiple fonts.

## A few words
- Make sure to add the Core Text framework before adding the class to your project.
- I built the sample project using iOS 5.1, but there's no reason it shouldn't work going back to iOS 3.2 I think [but I've only tested the class back to 4.3].
